# bls
Precompiled bls library for go

This library use the precompiled [bls](https://github.com/herumi/bls) and [mcl](https://github.com/herumi/mcl).
Thank [herumi](https://github.com/herumi) for the great work.

And this library also bundle with [GMP](https://gmplib.org/) for the dependency.

## Note

Because of the precompiled libs are managed by `git-lfs`, so before `go get github.com/moonfruit/bls` or simply clone the repository, you must install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) first.
